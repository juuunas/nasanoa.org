## The need to recognize

This post is going to list 5 artists, whose work in my opinion needs more recognition and also what many core-listeners might like.

Keep in my mind this is mostly just music that I very much like and I wish more people would listen to. Not necessarily that the entire world population should be forced to like it.

### Misan7hrope

This artist is genuinely the most underrated I've seen. They make insanely chaotic _Breakcore_ with influence being drawn from many places. It's definitely the most _broken_ _Breakcore_ I have ever listened to, it's so good.

For a recommendation, Listen to their latest album on ENDE records <OutboundLink href="https://enderecords.bandcamp.com/album/ende358-misan7hrope-dadaist-preschool" display="here" />.

### Non Human

`Non Human` is a name I never hear anyone talking about. The artist is probably long gone to new ventures since at least 2013, but it's still some of my favorite _Breakcore_ I've listened to.

They make breaks insanely compressed and noisy, sample some cool 2000's pop music and finish it off with cool rave elements. If you like `Shoebill`'s music, you are going to love it.

Their best work is the 2009 EP **War Nah Done**, I would put a download but all the download links are dead so you need to pirate it somewhere (Soulseek).

### Sven Noon

This artist makes really well produced _Breakcore_ with pretty odd time signatures, it's pretty unique, for what it tries to be. It's a joy to listen to every time. Very nice person too.

Their song _eternal 11_ was probably my most favorite song of last year, so much so I made my own spin-off of the provided stems for the track too. Lol.

Checkout their latest release <OutboundLink href="https://sven-noon.bandcamp.com/album/veki-o-aliflanke-2" display="here" />.

### Lneheb

I think they were my first ever follower on SoundCloud, if I recall correctly. Their sound is pretty aggressive with an emotional touch, it's honestly just crazy and very well produced, I like it a lot.

If you are a _Renoise_ producer, they have some videos on YouTube, where they show their break chopping techniques along other things, if you are interested.

My personal favorite release of theirs is <OutboundLink href="https://lneheb.bandcamp.com/album/the-face-of-depression" display="this EP" />.

### the gay hero of appletown

I first heard this artist in the **COREPULSIVE** compilation and I was impressed of the production and the crazy breaks. I really want to hear more stuff from them, it's really good.

Checkout their <OutboundLink href="https://soundcloud.com/svorke" display="SoundCloud" /> and also their latest release <OutboundLink href="https://thegayheroofappletown.bandcamp.com/album/un" display="here" />.

## Closing words

These were artists I have been enjoying a lot and some happen to be a lot smaller than I am. Hope you check them out.

2 posts in a weeks time, I'm having fun with this. Not sure how long it will last.
