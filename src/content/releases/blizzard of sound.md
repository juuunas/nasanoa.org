## A split with `mashiro`

This split has been a long time coming, it's been half a year since we first got the idea to do it and it's finally out now, on CD as well.

It's a split of mainly _emotional Breakcore_, with touches of other core genres as well, it was fun to make and see it all come together, I think `mashiro` did a really cool job with the art, very excited to get my hands on the CD.

My favorite track from it is probably _desolate_.
