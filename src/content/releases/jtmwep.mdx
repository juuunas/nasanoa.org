The summer used to feel like it was best time of life when I was younger, but nowadays it basically feels like any other time in the year. This summer was the first one that truly felt like "wow, I'm not a kid anymore", mostly because I was working night shifts in a really physical job. (that was a really good experience in it's own way and I loved it + I got a lot of money saved up now lol)

Just going to work and sleeping with not much time to do anything else kind of made me sad and nostalgic kind of. I started thinking how could I expose this feeling with music?

That's when I found _Head In The Ceiling Fan_ by _Title Fight_. The music video made me feel so much different feelings and I instantly got the idea to sample it. I continued going through the genre and finding lots of good songs, artists and more stuff to sample. (_Arm's Length_ was my favorite band I found I still listen to them a lot!)

So I started making this EP, themed around how summer used to feel and how it feels now. Most of the songs were made in one singular session each. It also has remixes from `mashiro` and `mechakawagirl`. With beautiful cover art from `COSMO`!

My favorite track from it is `nufi`.
