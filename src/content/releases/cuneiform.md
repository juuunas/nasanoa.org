## A split with `axtrmnt`

This is a split that means a lot to me. I hope everyone will enjoy it.

It varies a bit in style and also has a collab track between us two. (Fun fact, a collab between us was supposed to happen years ago, but it just never got finished back then because of stuff.)

I really like the song _fare well_, as it's in a style that I really want to make more of in the future.
