# About me

My name is Joonas, 20 years old and from Finland.

My interests are making music, listening to music, DJ. I also like web development (as you can see) and programming tech stuff in general

### Music

I really got into music after discovering `goreshit` from OSU. After listening to their whole discography on repeat for a year straight, I found `axtrmnt` from a discord server I was in and from there I found `Waqs` and other cool people.

I like _Breakcore_ a lot, but I also like _Witch House_, _Footwork_ _Hi-Tech_, _ug rap_ and also a lot of the other _Hardcore_ subgenres, like _Hardtek_. Recently I've started listening to more mainstream music too

For breaks my main inspiration is `weyheyhey`, but there is many different inspirations for other aspects of my style

#### My favorite breakcore artists (kind of in order)

- TechDiff (+ all the peace off ppl)
- Tusk Mite
- KenKoTaiji
- sHimaU
- I Broke My Robot

### About this site

It's made with the static site generator `Astro` as an attempt to learn how to use it. Also with the help of `Tailwind`.

The source is available <OutboundLink href="https://github.com/juuunas/nasanoa.org" display="here" /> if you are interested.

I might rewrite it soon.
