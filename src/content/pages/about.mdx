# About me

My name is Joonas, 19 years old and from Finland.

My interests are making music, listening to music, DJ, Linux and ummm drinking beer. I also like web development (as you can see).

### Music

I really got into music after discovering `goreshit` from OSU. After listening to their whole discography on repeat for a year straight, I found `axtrmnt` from a discord server I was in and from there I found `Waqs` and other cool people.

I like _Breakcore_ a lot, but I also like _Glitch_, _Trashwave_, _Hi-Tech_, some _finnish rap_ and also a lot of the other _Hardcore_ subgenres, like _Hardtek_.

My main inspiration is `weyheyhey`, but there are a lot of other smaller inspirations.

#### My favorite artists (kind of in order)

- TechDiff (+ all the peace off ppl)
- Tusk Mite
- KenKoTaiji
- sHimaU
- I Broke My Robot
